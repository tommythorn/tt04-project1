# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  title:        "Three latches"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Try three different ways to make a latch."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      First way, let yosys decide.

      Second way, couple a pair of NAND gates

      Third way, tie the output to an input on the majority gate and
      make a C-element (which is essentially a latch).

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Each of the latches gets one output and two inputs.  Toggle them to see if they work.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:
    - latch1 D
    - latch1 WE
    - latch2 A
    - latch2 B
    - latch3 A
    - latch3 B
    - unused
    - unused
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - latch1 Q
    - latch2 Q
